 	<h3>NAnt Only Integration</h3>

	The following is the typical scenario of how NCover fits into a continuous build process. 
	It is designed to be easily slotted into a continuous build process such as <a href="http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/">CruiseControl.NET</a>.

	<ol>
		<li>Before you update from your source control system, run the <a href="tasks/nrecover.html">nrecover task</a> 
			(to deinstrument your source files in case the previous build failed).
		<li>Run <a href="tasks/ncover.html">ncover task</a> to instrument your source code.</li>
		<li>Compile.</li>
		<li>Run your tests.</li>
		<li>Run <a href="tasks/ncoverreport.html">ncoverreport task</a> to generate your report.</li>
		<li>Run the <a href="tasks/nrecover.html">nrecover task</a> to deinstrument your source files.
	</ol>

	Then all you need to do is add a link from the build website to point to the latest generated coverage report<br/>
	(and keep those coverage percentages up!).

	</div>

	<div id="section">
	<h3>Multiple Reports</h3>

	The ncover, nrecover and ncoverreport tasks each take a report name.
	To output multiple reports duplicate all calls to these three tasks with reportname='xxx'.

	<p>There is
	<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/ncover/ncover/Example.build?view=markup">
		an example multiple report nant build file</a> that creates two reports - ncover's own coverage
		and ncover's tests coverage. The second is designed to find dead code in tests (it's either obsolete code or
		not testing what you thought it was).

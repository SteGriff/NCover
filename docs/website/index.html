	<h3>Goals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Simplicity</li>
		<li>Speed - it doesn't profile, it just checks coverage.</li>
		<li>Designed to be dropped into a continuous build cycle</li>
		<li>Keep line numbers the same -> Test failure stacktraces stay useful</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Upgrading from previous NCover versions</h3>

		There are three breaking changes with this new release, these are:	

	<li>To compile instrumented code, you will now need to reference the NCover.dll</li>
	<li>The NAnt tasks have been seperated out into a seperate assembly (NCoverNAnt.dll), so you will now
	have to reference this assembly in the loadtasks part of the nant build file.</li>
	<li>The ncoverreport task now takes a mandatory parameter named "actuals" which
	is a filename pointing to the output from running the tests upon the instrumented code.</li>

		Please see the <a href="nant-integration.html">docs</a> for further details.

	<h3>News</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Version 0.9.2 released see <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for details</li>

		<li>Now supports Visual Basic.NET code!</i>

		<li>We've enhanced the diff functionality so you can see how changes to the code have affected the coverage
	percentage (for better or for worse).</li>
		<li>Thanks to ideas from Michael Luke, setting up ncover is now easier than before - you just have to link to the dll.
	(well maybe a little bit more than that is needed, but it's easier than it was.) (Thanks Michael)</li>
